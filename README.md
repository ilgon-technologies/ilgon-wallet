ILGON Wallet is a doorway to the Ilgon blockchain, allowing users to manage their own funds without a centralized platform.

## Philosophy

* **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to interact with the Ilgon blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
* **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ilgon & Tokens without additional cost.
* **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
* **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Ilgon, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ilgon and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
* **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
* **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
* **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
* **Open source & auditable**
